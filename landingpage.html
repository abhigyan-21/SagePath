            Welcome, brave traveler. I am Lumora, the Sage of Light. For centuries, knowledge has been our shield, yet a
            shadow looms… Dimora, the bringer of ignorance, spreads darkness across the land. His minions — confusion,
            doubt, and fear — seek to weaken the minds of all who walk this world.

            But you, chosen one, have stepped upon the SagePath. Here, every lesson you master, every skill you forge,
            is a
            weapon against the darkness. You will face trials as battles, earn badges as victories, and gather
            companions
            who grow with you in strength.

            Rise, seeker of wisdom. The journey ahead will test your courage and sharpen your mind. Step forth, and let
            us
            drive back Dimora's shadow together, with the light of knowledge as our sword.
